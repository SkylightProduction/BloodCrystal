# Blood crystal
A small addon for the [Enhanced Celestials](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enhanced-celestials) mod, created in 10 minutes in MCreator for the Nihomium modpack. Which will be released sometime in late 2023 (hopefully).
The addon adds a special item through which you can summon the Blood Moon by pressing RMB on any creature. **The item drops from a zombie with a 10% chance.**
